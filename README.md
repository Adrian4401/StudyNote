=== DESCRIPTION ===

StudyNote is an app mainly for students (but not only) who want to have notes and an exams calendar in one place. The main advantage of this app compared to others is the possibility to attach previously added notes to exams where the same subject is set. Another advantage is the possibility to assign previously added subjects and classes to notes and exams. I'm developing this app for my Engineering work to complete my studies. It's the first app I've developed entirely on my own (frontend, backend and database).
