=== DESCRIPTION ===

StudyNote is an app mainly for students (but not only) who want to have notes and an exams calendar in one place. The main advantage of this app compared to others is the possibility to attach previously added notes to exams where the same subject is set. Another advantage is the possibility to assign previously added subjects and classes to notes and exams. I'm developing this app for my Engineering work to complete my studies. It's the first app I've developed entirely on my own (frontend, backend and database).



=== HOW TO USE ===

1. You need to install:
    - Node.js
    - a code editor (I recommend Visual Studio Code)
    - extensions in the code editor (for Visual Studio Code: Live Server and ES7+)
2. Import the repository from GitHub.
3. Run the command 'npm i' and then 'npm start'.
4. You can view the app on an Android emulator using Android Studio or on your phone by installing the Expo Go app from the store.
